#### What you need

* An internet connection on your Vita / PS TV

#### Instructions

##### Section I: HENkaku Easy Update Server Setup

1. Open the Settings app.
2. Select 'Network'.
3. Select 'Wi-Fi Settings'
4. If you are not connected to the internet, do so now.
5. Select your current connection. (Should have a green dot to the left.)
6. Select 'Advanced Settings'
7. Under 'DNS Settings', choose 'Manual'
8. Set 'Primary DNS' to '212.47.229.76'.
9. Leave 'Secondary DNS' blank.
10. Make sure 'Proxy Server' is set to 'Do Not Use'.
11. Press OK and back out to the main settings screen.

##### Section II: Updating to 3.60

1. Select 'System Update'.
2. Select 'Update Using Wi-Fi'
3. If you get an error saying your system is up to date, that means either your Vita is on 3.60 already, or it is on a firmware > 3.60 and is not supported by HENkaku.
4. Make sure that the update says '3.60 (変革 Compatible)', if it says anything else, make sure you followed ALL the Steps!
5. Proceed with the update process and wait for the system to reboot.

You can now go back into your Advanced Wi-Fi settings and change your DNS settings back if you would like, however, if you leave the DNS Settings alone after updating, you get an aditional update blocker so you wont accidentally update to an unhackable firmware version. {: .notice--info}
